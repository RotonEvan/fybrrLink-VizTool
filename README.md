## Modified Bresenham's Routing Algorithm Visualizer for Satellite Networks

Written in Django with [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/ "NetworkX Homepage") for visualization. Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) is the future. With fybrrLink we are building a Quality-of-Service Aware Routing algorithm in a Software Defined Networking environment for Satellite Networks. We'll propose a flow rule transfer protocol as well for SDN in NTN.
